# Seq2Seq-Text-Summarization
Text summarization for Times of India news dataset.

Surrounding by state-of-the-art technological innovations has exponentially increased our daily interaction with a huge amount of data circulating in digital space. 
Text summarization has emerged as one of the most popular applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP), which is bound to have significant impacts on humansâ€™ lives. 
Since a considerable amount of such data has appeared in the format of textual formats, automated text summarization techniques have emerged as an effective approach aimed to shorten long text documents. 
In other words, machine learning algorithms can be trained to generate a meaningful, precise, and relevant summary of massive textual information, with the main focus on summarizing the original text and delivering the sections that convey useful information, without losing the main concepts and overall meaning.
We have used extractive text summarization methods on two main machine learning algorithms, both using a Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) - Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM).
